# Rode0Triage
Repository for my May Rode0Day Results 

## Competition

In this repository are the raw fuzzing results from my May Rode0Day fuzzing. As a competition, I'm looking for people to help me triage and exploit as many of these as possible. This is because none of the bugs injected are intentionally vulnerable, much like real fuzzing efforts, many of these crashes are likely non-exploitable.

## Entering

If you're interested in entering, grab a copy of this repo, and start triaging these crashes. You'll probably want to start by categorizing the various crashes, to see what types of crashes we're getting. After that, you'll need to determine which (if any) are exploitable. You'll need the executables, which are available here: https://rode0day.mit.edu/static/archive/19.05.tar.gz

I'll have prizes in the form of 3x Hacking 2.0 Humble eBook Bundles for various writeups/exploits for people who enter. 

Once you've done your triaging and exploitation, feel free to send me a pull request adding your triage to the list of entries. Also, send me a tweet at @murmusCTF so I can share your writeups.

## Prizes

Prizes will be given in the following manner:

* The best writeup (either text or video) on the process of triaging and exploiting these crashes, as determined by me. I'll almost certainly be giving points for depth of writeup and the categorization of crashes.
* The best exploit, also as determined by me. This will probably be the most elegant exploit that gets submitted.
* Wildcard. The third bundle will be given out to an entry I think is "interesting", but doesn't necessarily fit in the other two categories.

## End of Competition

The competition will end when episode 5 of the Rode0Day series goes live on Youtube. Barring any major hiccups in getting episodes out, that means it will be July 23rd.
